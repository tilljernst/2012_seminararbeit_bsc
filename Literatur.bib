@article{Daft:1986,
	Abstract = {This paper answers the question, ``Why do organizations process information?''Uncertainty and equivocality are defined as two forces that influence information processing in organizations. Organization structure and internal systems determine both the amount and richness of information provided to managers. Models are proposed that show how organizations can be designed to meet the information needs of technology, interdepartmental relations, and the environment. One implication for managers is that a major problem is lack of clarity, not lack of data. The models indicate how organizations can be designed to provide information mechanisms to both reduce uncertainty and resolve equivocality.},

@article{Ackerman:2011,
	Abstract = {The Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) is a widely used measure of narcissism. However, debates persist about its exact factor structure with researchers proposing solutions ranging from two to seven factors. The present research aimed to clarify the factor structure of the NPI and further illuminate its nomological network. Four studies provided support for a three-factor model consisting of the dimensions of Leadership/Authority, Grandiose Exhibitionism, and Entitlement/Exploitativeness. The Leadership/Authority dimension was generally linked to adaptive outcomes whereas the other two dimensions, particularly Entitlement/Exploitativeness, were generally linked to maladaptive outcomes. These results suggest that researchers interested in the psychological and behavioral outcomes associated with the NPI should examine correlates at the facet level. In light of the findings, we propose a hierarchical model for the structure of the NPI and provide researchers with a scoring scheme for this commonly used instrument.},

	Abstract = {The present study involves the development of a new self-report scale for the use of Internet services, and examines its relationship to extraversion and neuroticism. Forty-five males and 27 females, differing in extraversion and neuroticism, rated the frequency with which they use each of 12 main Internet services. An exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors of Internet services: social services; information services; and leisure services. Extraversion and neuroticism showed different patterns of relationships with the factors of the Internet-Services Scale, with different patterns of association for men and women. For men, extraversion was positively related to the use of leisure services and neuroticism was negatively related to information services, whereas for women, extraversion was negatively related and neuroticism positively related to the use of social services. Implications for the study of the psychological influences of the Internet are discussed.},

Our suggestion firstly builds a user{\^a}‚Ç¨{\texttrademark}s emotion profile in terms of the personality, mood and emotion by analysing the user{\^a}‚Ç¨{\texttrademark}s activities in social network. This subsequently builds an Emotional Relationship Matrix (ERM) which represents the depth of the emotional relationship based on the emotion profile. From our proposal, the more elaborate services based on the current user{\^a}‚Ç¨{\texttrademark}s emotional state can be provided to users. By considering emotional aspects in a social network, we can effectively answer which users or media contents will show the best results for inducing users{\^a}‚Ç¨{\texttrademark} emotional states. From the experiments, we verified that message containing emotional words and users{\^a}‚Ç¨{\texttrademark} relationship in a social network has significant correlations.},

	Abstract = {The social networking site, Facebook, has gained an enormous amount of popularity. In this article, we review the literature on the factors contributing to Facebook use. We propose a model suggesting that Facebook use is motivated by two primary needs: (1) the need to belong and (2) the need for self-presentation. Demographic and cultural factors contribute to the need to belong, whereas neuroticism, narcissism, shyness, self-esteem and self-worth contribute to the need for self-presentation. Areas for future research are discussed.},

Undergraduate students identified their reasons for using Facebook, privacy and self-disclosure settings, and satisfaction with Facebook{\^a}‚Ç¨{\texttrademark}s ability to meet these motivational needs. Results indicated that the most common motives for using Facebook were relationship maintenance, passing time, and entertainment, although gender differences in motives for creating a Facebook page were observed. Males and females also differed in the overall level of self-disclosure as well as the type of information presented on their Facebook pages. Levels of self-disclosure, but not privacy levels, were associated with greater levels of satisfaction with Facebook to meet certain motivational goals.},

	Abstract = {In diesem Beitrag wird auf der Grundlage von Mediensozialisationsstudien dar{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬ºber reflektiert, wie die Medien in der heutigen Gesellschaft als Risiken und Ressourcen f{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬ºr die Identit{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬§tskonstruktion von Kindern wirksam werden (S{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬ºss 2004). Die Mediensozialisationsforschung befasst sich dabei mit dem Spannungsverh{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬§ltnis von Selbstsozialisation und bewusst gestalteter Erziehung (Fromme et al. 1999). In einer in 12 europ{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬§ischen L{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬§ndern durchgef{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬ºhrten Studie wurden insgesamt etwa 15.000 Kinder von 6 bis 16 Jahren befragt (vgl. Livingstone/Bovill 2001). Dabei zeigte sich, dass das Fernsehen nach wie vor das Leitmedium im Alltag der Kinder ist, heute gefolgt von Computer und Internet (vor allem bei Knaben) und dem Handy (vor allem bei M{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬§dchen). In nachfolgenden Studien haben wir diesen Trend weiter verfolgt (S{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬ºss et al. 2003a, 2003b). Die neuesten Schweizer Kinder-Medienstudien weisen in dieselbe Richtung (Forschungsdienst SRG SSR 2004, Husar 2005). Im Folgenden soll aufgezeigt werden, wie Kinder und Jugendliche sich im reichen Medienensemble ihrer Lebenswelten zurechtfinden und unter welchen Bedingungen Medien zu Risiken und zu Ressourcen f{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬ºr die Kindheit werden k{\~A}∆í{\^A}¬∂nnen. Zuerst sollen aber die theoretischen Konstrukte der Mediensozialisationsforschung kritisch diskutiert werden.},
